# The Hub Framework

The Hub Framework is a Spotify feature developer toolkit that aims to reduce a lot of the boilerplate and code duplication involved in developing a feature for the iOS app. The goal is to  automate a series of repetitive developer tasks and let feature developers focus on what makes their feature awesome.

This repository contains Hub Framework functionality that has no dependencies on client-ios and can operate independently.

Over time, more and more functionality will be moved from the HubFeature in client-ios into this repository.
