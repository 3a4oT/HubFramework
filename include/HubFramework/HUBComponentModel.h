/**
 *  Protocol defining the public API of a model object that is used for a Component in the Hub Framework
 *
 *  You don't conform to this protocol yourself, instead the Hub Framework will create implementations of it
 *  for you based on the data supplied to a `HUBComponentModelBuilder` or through JSON data.
 *
 *  See also `HUBComponent` that acts as the controller for a view that renders the data from a `HUBComponentModel`.
 *
 *  What pieces of data each individual component supports is up to them. It's also up to the components themselves
 *  to control their own rendering of the data contained in a model like this. However, it's always safe to assign any
 *  of the properties in this model, regardless of component implementation. Components that don't support a certain
 *  piece of data (like `subtitle` or `descriptionText` for example), will simply choose to ignore those properties.
 *
 *  This protocol defines an immutable component model, for its mutable counterpart; see `HUBComponentModelBuilder`.
